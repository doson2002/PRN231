# Mentor Booking System (MBS)


## 0. Introduction

A platform designed to connect students with mentors, facilitating skill development, project support, and guidance through structured mentorship. The system is tailored to meet the needs of three key user roles: **Students**, **Mentors**, and **Admins**, each with specific functions to ensure a seamless mentoring experience.

- **Students**: Students can manage their project groups, assign mentors to their projects based on required skills, and view their profile and performance points. MBS allows students to search for mentors with specific expertise, book mentorship sessions, and get valuable guidance for their projects.

- **Mentors**: Mentors can showcase their skills and certifications, set and manage their schedules, and verify bookings from students. MBS also allows mentors to verify and manage group requests, providing a streamlined way to engage with students on specific project needs.

- **Admins**: Administrators oversee the system, configuring points awarded to students, managing and approving mentors, and monitoring the feedback from student-mentor interactions. This role ensures the quality and effectiveness of mentorship sessions and maintains the overall integrity of the system.
